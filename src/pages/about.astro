			<h2>How I work</h2>
			<h3><span class='text-accent'>1.</span> Start from first principles 1Ô∏è‚É£</h3>
			<p>
				I believe that to truly solve a problem, you have to work hard to understand the real
				context behind it. Nothing matters if you aren't truly grappling with the problem underneath
				the problem.
			</p>
			<h3><span class='text-accent'>2.</span> People-first leadership üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h3>
			<p>
				Creating enduring, impactful products is a team sport. I believe in building teams that are
				the right size, comprised of the right people, that care about each other deeply, and that
				have the space and safety to work creatively and quickly.
			</p>
			<h3><span class='text-accent'>3.</span> Build systems to move fast ‚öôÔ∏è</h3>
			<p>
				When you know what needs to be done, you need to be able to move fast. I believe in building
				systems that allow you to move efficiently, and that are flexible enough to change as you
				learn more.
			</p>
			<h3><span class='text-accent'>4.</span> Every problem is a gem üíé</h3>
			<p>
				Different problems require different approaches. I believe in using the right approach for
				the job, and that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Knowing how to adapt to each
				situation is key.
			</p>
			<h3><span class='text-accent'>5.</span> Wireframe & prototype when you're stuck ‚úèÔ∏è</h3>
			<p>
				When the path forward is unclear, exploration through prototyping, sharing internally,
				testing externally, and iteration is better than over-solving slowly.
			</p>

			<h3><span class='text-accent'>6.</span> No bullshit üí©</h3>
			<p>
				Doing great work is hard enough without having to deal with politics, ego, or other
				friction. I believe in being direct, honest, and transparent, and that the best work happens
				when you're working with people you trust.
			</p>
