## Techniques

### TEDW

At a Friends of Figma meetup, [Zander Whitehurst](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zanderwhitehurst/) mentioned this acronym to help form open-ended questions on the spot.

When you use these phrases to begin your questions, it helps you have open-ended conversations with participants and reveals stories and insights.

The letters stand for:

- “Tell me...” or “Talk me through...”
- “Explain...”
- “Describe...”
- “Walk me through...”
