## Qwilr

Understanding what the next step in our design careers looks like can be tricky, and often opaque. To help designers at Qwilr mould a future shape in their role, I've written how key skills change with experience, and how designers (at every level) can aim for a higher standard in their work, and how we can all be made up of very different skill constellations.

## Vend

We settled on 8 broad competencies (that looks like one of those Top 8 lists): User Research, Usability Evaluation, Information Architecture, Interaction Design, Visual Design, Writing, Prototyping and Leadership.
