## The best way to make more interesting work is to become a more interesting person.

In this case, interesting means the continual projection of interest. To be curious about the world around you, and to seek out knowledge whenever possible.

## Pay attention to what you pay attention to.

Mindfulness, and restraint. Be aware of what you are taking in, and how that affects what you are putting out. Chase the things that you do when you're not working. For every yes there are a thousand no's.

## Assume positive intent.

Not because people are good, but because of [Hanlon's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor).

> “Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.”

## The web is a commonwealth.

It's also a marketplace. It's a place that breeds culture, but increasingly also breeds the negative side effects of commerce. It's up to us to make sure the web remains a place that's comfortable to occupy.

## Don't boil the ocean.

Begin with a minimum viable product, solving for customer experience. Start with a cupcake. Then move on to the cake and finally, the wedding cake.

## If it’s worth doing, it’s worth doing poorly.

Don't let perfectionism get in the way of progress. It's better to do something poorly than to not do it at all.
