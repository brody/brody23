## 1. Start with your writing action plan

Write down who you're writing for, and what you'd like them to remember after reading your post.

## 2. Write a “shitty first draft”

Author Anne Lamott says all writing begins with a “really, really shitty first draft.”

Go somewhere nice to write. A cafe perhaps, or a quiet place you can focus. Keep going to the same place to build your “muscle memory” of writing there. Then, just go go go! Be yourself and have fun! Start writing.

## 3. Mine for gold

Review what you've written and “mine for gold”, per writing teacher Leslie Kirk Campbell. Highlight the phrases that work well and the ideas that should be “unpacked”. Ask friends for help with this.

Then start sorting your content into different “chunks” of information. What is each section about? Tip: print it out and cut it up.

## 4. Add structure

<div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row !ml-0 md:wide gap-8 -mt-4">
<div>
A. The intro paragraph should tell readers what you're writing about, and why they should care. Save the details and supporting information for later on.

B. Be clear and upfront about what you're suggesting people do after they read. Knowing “the ask” can help your reader relax and absorb the following details.

C. Add interesting deadlines and subheadlines. Sub-headers make everything easier to scan.

D. Use quotes, sketches, team photos, videos, GIFs, emoji, and other images to communicate ideas.

E. Formatting cheats that aren't cheating:

- Use bullets to make lists easy to read.
- Add numbers to clarify steps or big ideas.
- Use built-in templated styles for headers, sub-headers, quotes, etc.

F. Summarise and add your “calls to action” and relevant links.

</div>
<div class="">
import { Image } from 'astro:assets'
import plan from '/public/assets/journal/writing-best-practices/plan.svg'

<Image
	src={plan}
	alt='Writing best practices visual plan'
	className='!my-0 md:!mt-7 md:min-w-[200px]'
/>

</div>

</div>

## 5. Edit. Sleep.

Ask a friend. Edit again.

## 6. Publish

Share. Enjoy people's quick responses to your hard work. Share again. They probably didn't get it.

## 7. You've got this!

You'll find the right works even faster and with more confidence every time.
