Making choices as a team is important for getting stuff done together. First make sure everyone knows what's up - that they understand the idea or plan being proposed and why it's a good idea. It's also crucial that everyone gets a say in what you decide.

Once you've all chatted about the topic, you'll need to pick an option. Some ways teams vote are:

## Polling

For in-person & Zoom meetings, a Roman voting technique can be employed. Members express support with a thumbs-up, concerns with a thumbs-down, or neutrality with a sideways thumb.

## Fist to Five

This technique, used in Agile Teams, helps gauge agreement levels. Members show a closed fist for disagreement or display fingers (from one to five) indicating their level of support. If anyone shows fewer than three fingers, further discussion is necessary before voting again.

## Dot Voting

Ideas are presented, and each member uses a sticky note or dot to vote for their top choice. Tallying the votes determines the option with the most support. In case of a tie, repeat the process or explore alternative voting techniques.

As I mentioned in a [recent post](/journal/dot-voting), dot voting has some troubles that can cause false or misleading results.

The key is making sure all voices are heard, opinions understood, and you agree as a group on the best path forward. Communication and compromise are crucial to making team choices that work for everyone.
