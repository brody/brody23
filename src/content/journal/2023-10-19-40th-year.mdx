Today is my 39th birthday & I wanted to start the last year of my 30s with a set of goals to guide me in the next year.

What better accountability buddy than the entire internet?

## Professional goals

### 52 journal posts

Writing has been something Iâ€™ve wanted to do for a long time, but havenâ€™t made it a habit. Giving myself a weekly goal will force me to flex and improve my writing muscle.

### Read 30 books

From fiction to nonfiction, paperback, Kindle or audiobook â€” 30 isnâ€™t an enormous number, but gives me an achievable measurable goal.

### 12 networking events

Iâ€™ve really enjoyed getting back to meetups & connecting with the design community so adding this to encourage me to get to meetups and reach out for coffee chats.

## Health goals

### 365 meditations in the year

Iâ€™m fairly consistent with getting a daily 10-minute meditation in during the weekdays but want to get weekend sits in too.

### Fast until midday 6 days/week

Time-restricted feeding has a range of benefits from promoting blood sugar control, reducing inflammation, to increasing growth hormone secretion. Iâ€™ve reserved 1 day to go to brunch with my wife and friends.

### No phone for 6 hours on the weekend

After reading books like The Shallows**,** Stolen Focus & Digital Minimalism, I wanted to put an intentional phone break in place to fight the itch to check my phone.

### Lose 12kg

1kg a month should be more than achievable but the main thing will be consistency & avoiding the dreaded Christmas season blow out. ðŸŽ…

## Fitness goals

### Running goals

500km run in the year â€” Iâ€™ve enjoyed getting back into running & 500km ends up being only one 10km run a week.

Run 5km in 22.5 minutes â€” I ran my last (and first) Parkrun recently in 24:13, which I felt was good but I feel I could shave that down to 4.5 min/km.

Run 10km in 50 minutes â€” The last time I did a sub-50 minute 10km was in 2018. Hopefully, I can turn back time and get back meet the same time.

### Strength goals

150 workouts â€” Iâ€™m looking to get back into a regular workout routine. 3 sessions a week paired with a run or 2 should be the right amount of exercise for the week.

10 pull-ups â€” Iâ€™ve always struggled with pull-ups. Combining consistent training, dropping some weight & intentional focus on pull-ups should help me get to 10 reps. ðŸ¤ž
