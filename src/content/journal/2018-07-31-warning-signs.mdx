You can tell a lot about your initial experience with a company.
I've had poor experiences with both big and small companies.

Conversely, I've had well managed experiences, between initial interactions as well as onboarding, indicative of companies who are intentional about every part of the company.

The recruitment process is a highly tension-filled time, but don't ignore your spidey-sense about the clunky first experience, as it will most likely reflect the entire companies culture.
