Rather than regarding work as a final destination, view it as a pathway to realizing your true purpose.

Jot down your primary skills, experiences, and values, and then condense them into a concise "core perspective" or purpose statement.

Now, the next step is to identify strategies for fulfilling that purpose, which can be achieved through the establishment of specific goals.

When considering possible goals, ask:

- Does this connect to my purpose?
- Do I actually care about achieving this goal?
- Is this a goal I can actually achieve?
- How will I know if Iâ€™m making progress?
