	This article covers how we developed our tokens at Prospa to create a flexible taxonomy for a
	small but powerful set of semantic tokens.

Prospa's mission is to _make business happen_ by providing small business owners with the cash flow solutions
they need to grow and prosper. We are Australia's #1 online lender to small business and committed to
helping small business owners access the funds they need to grow.

After rolling out a rebrand through the legacy design systems, we decided to build a new design system from the ground up. This was a great opportunity to rethink our approach to tokens and how we could make them more flexible and semantic.

## The problem

The existing set of design styles in the legacy design system was comprised mainly of primitives and a few component-specific tokens.

Only a small handful of colors were represented as semantic tokens & even those were being used haphazardly throughout Prospa's apps. For Prospa's design system and our consumers, this system was problematic.

After conducting multiple rounds of interviews with our design systems consuming teams, which included both designers and developers, we identified several significant pain points:

1. Component token names were <mark>difficult to understand</mark>
1. Component token <mark>names were lengthy</mark>, and were truncated in Figma
1. There were <mark>too many tokens</mark> to choose from
1. Teams had <mark>difficulty identifying rationale</mark> behind token use

		users.

</figure>

These problems left our design systems consuming teams **devoid of any of the logic or rationale behind design decisions**. There was no way for them to understand semantically which tokens were applied to specific use cases. This **stalled their capabilities in extending the system logic to their own custom components and experiences**. The usability issues left individuals at a loss; resulting in their use of primitives directly.

Individuals explicitly, and directly requested a better set of semantic tokens so that they could apply styles with an understanding of the rationale, and to clearly communicate between designers and developers regarding how to construct their components.
