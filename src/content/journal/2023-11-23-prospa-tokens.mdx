	This article covers how we developed our tokens at Prospa to create a flexible taxonomy for a
	small but powerful set of semantic tokens.

Prospa's mission is to _make business happen_ by providing small business owners with the cash flow solutions
they need to grow and prosper. We are Australia's #1 online lender to small business and committed to
helping small business owners access the funds they need to grow.

After rolling out a rebrand through the legacy design systems, we decided to build a new design system from the ground up. This was a great opportunity to rethink our approach to tokens and how we could make them more flexible and semantic.

## The problem

The existing set of design styles in the legacy design system was comprised mainly of primitives and a few component-specific tokens.

Only a small handful of colors were represented as semantic tokens & even those were being used haphazardly throughout Prospa's apps. For Prospa's design system and our consumers, this system was problematic.
